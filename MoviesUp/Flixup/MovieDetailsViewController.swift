        titleLabel.text =  movie["title"] as? String //title is what the api calls the title of the moview

        synopsisLabel.sizeToFit()
        
        // two images to set: potser view and backdrop view:
        //for cells i built up the url from baseurl extracting img from net so we use that here:
        //a setting the poster view:
        let baseUrl = "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185" //retrieved from the documentation
        let posterPath = movie["poster_path"] as! String
        //need to combine baseurl with path:
        let posterUrl = URL(string: baseUrl+posterPath)
        //supports posterview directly so no need cell.posterView
        posterView.af_setImage(withURL: posterUrl!)
        
        //b. setting the backdrop view: its called the backdrop path:
        let backdropPath = movie["backdrop_path"] as! String
        //need to combine baseurl with path:
        let backdropUrl = URL(string: "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w780" + backdropPath) //updating pixels in url, because the backdrop image is larger and the resolution is poor...780 is the width available for backdrop img. resolution resolved!

        backDropView.af_setImage(withURL: backdropUrl!)
        
        //making gradient:
        let gradientUrl = URL(string: "https://i.imgur.com/KcGCJyn.png")
        gradientView.af_setImage(withURL: gradientUrl!) //SUCCESS!
